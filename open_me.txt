

to my dearest jananan,

words will never be enough for me to properly convey how much i value you and your existence. but i still hope this small gift can help express a fraction of my love for you.
theres over a hundred little notes i left for you. every time you click the jar with the kitty, one of these notes will pop up. i wanted to make more than just a hundred because there is so much more i could've said to you but i also wanted to make sure you got this in time for christmas. so ill keep adding to this website. and hopefully one day the notes here will exceed 
all those negative thoughts you think and you'll realise that you are so much more beautiful than you think.

merry christmas and a very, very happy new year.
